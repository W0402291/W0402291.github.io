	      <h2>Overview</h2>
	      <p>Linear Smith Machines are the ultimate in weight machines and the LSM400
           leads the field. Designed for both serious fitness users and beginners, the
           LSM400's vertical design provides all of the safety and control associated
           with Smith Machines, while still allowing for the effective use of gravity
           for effective resistance. You don't even need a workout partner. Lock points
           can be set to prevent the bar from movement outside of your body's natural
           range of motion.
	      </p>
	      <p>You can tailor the LSM400 to meet you specific workout needs. Start with the
           basic package of the Smith Machine rack and, as your needs grow, add a 
           lat/row, pec dec, plate tree, dip, and accessory organizer. Accessories are easy
           to insert and remove, allowing you to continue your workout without delay.   
           The LSM400 works with all standard Olympic weight plates.
	      </p>
	      <p>The LSM400 is compact with all components place one side of the unit for easy
          access. This makes the LSM400 perfect for people who want a quality home gym, but
          do not have a lot of space. Place the LSM400 against a wall and you're ready
          to go!

	      <h2>Features</h2>
	        <ul>
	          <li>
	            <strong>Smooth Smith Action:</strong>
	            <p>The bar (rated at 800 lb. capacity) slides on Teflon bushings
                 alongside solid steel guide rods. Smooth motion is key to successful workouts,
                 as the target muscles are utilized to their full potential with each repetition.<br />
